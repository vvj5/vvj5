<h2>"Brought you here, the galaxy has. Your path, clearly, this is."</h2>
<p>~Yoda</p>

<p>I have always liked Yoda. He may not be real (or IS HE?), but that’s not the point I’m trying to make with this piece.</p>

<p>No, dear reader, my point, like the stubby graphite of a pencil that’s been scraped back and forth across a concrete slab in the fist of a toddler, is that Yoda has some pretty epic quotes attributed to him.</p>

<h2>"DO NOT TRY! DO OR DO NOT, THERE IS NO TRY"</h2>
<p>~Yoda</p>

<p>I mean, sure, it’s dialogue derivative of Jung and such, but I still find it relevant, helpful and worthy of discussion. If you have a problem with that, then we’re probably not going to get along very well, and I also doubt Yoda would approve much of your bad attitude.</p>

<p>When I moved back to Australia in 2016, I knew I had a hard journey ahead of me. Hard like that time that when whiny ol’ Luke Skywalker went to Dagobah to study with Yoda. YES, I KNOW LUKE SKYWALKER ISN’T REAL EITHER, JUST GO WITH IT.</p>

<p>Anyway, suffice it to say that I had to prepare myself as well as I knew how for this adventure, and that involved channeling some Yodian mojo to help me keep my head straight.</p>

<p>Yes, I just made up a word to describe things a fictional character said as a school of philosophical thought. I’m ok with tha. And so should you be if we are to remain friends.</p>

<p>So as a contemplative exercise one day, I wrote a list of words that described Yodian attitudes and behaviors that I’d like to remind myself to stick to when things get tough.</p>

<p>The initial list was about 10 words, and I wanted to distill these down to a much smaller number that my “socks in a dryer” brain could hang-onto without too much extreme effort.</p>

<p>After literally weeks of meditation, deliberation and elimination, I emerged from the Dark Side Tree, having finalized my mantra words.</p>

<p>Ok, I didn’t actually go into a tree, but I did think about this a lot. I probably even looked at a tree or two.</p>

<h2>THE FOUR Ps</h2>
<p>I noticed a pattern in my words, and chose to stick with it, because a) it helped me remember them all, b) the words worked perfectly for me and c) saying “The Four Ps” sounds a lot cooler than saying “These Words I Came Up With”.</p>

<p>I wrote the words on my mirror in Sharpie. Did you know that nail polish remover will take permanent marker right off of glass, no problem? Don’t freak-out, thinking “Damn, Will just jacked-up his mirror!”</p>

<p>Anyway, I even put my words into an ordered protocol, in which I felt they built-upon one-another. I asked Yoda, and he backed me up. Hey, I can talk to all the fictional characters I want! If they answer, maybe I have a problem, but let’s just save that discussion for another time.</p>

<h2>P #1: PRESENT</h2>
<p>My mind needs to be able to focus on listening, learning, concentrating, experiencing, really being there with my family or with my team.</p>

<p>This means putting my phone away, turning all notifications off and focusing completely on the task at hand. Instagram just felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if a billion Likes just cried out and vanished.</p>

<h2>P #2: POSITIVE</h2>
<p>I sometimes need extra encouragement than most to remain positive. I felt this word could help clear my mind, prepare it for input and keep my stress-levels to a dull-roar. I have a tendency to take things hard and I get discouraged and frustrated. Positivity is a good word for me to focus on.</p>

<h2>P #3: PATIENT</h2>
<p>Despite having three young kids, I am not always a tremendously patient person, and, knowing this about myself, I sought to remind myself often to be patient - with my family, my team and myself.</p>

<h2>P #4: PERSISTENT</h2>
<p>This was one of the last words I came up with, and I feel is one of the most critical (though for me they are all mandatory).</p>

<p>I’d need to beat-down my frustration sometimes, reset, recheck my mantra and try again.</p>

<p>My friend Jeff once said, “It’s not how many times you get knocked down that matters, it’s how many times you get back up.” Jeff is a pretty Yodian dude, you’d like him.</p>

<p>So there you have them: Present, Positive, Patient and Persistent. In that order.</p>

<p>All of them have to be there (for me at least), and I needed to be reminded of all these things CONSTANTLY.</p>

<p>I do not always succeed at maintaining all of these traits. My point in using them is exactly for that reason.</p>

<p>These words are for ME, for MY weaknesses that I need help with on a regular basis. You’re welcome to use them too, I’m ok with that (I’ll send you an invoice). You may need to add or remove or change one or all of them. But that’s kind-of the point. This is just what I came up with - you might need totally different words. But coming up with a solid and manageable mantra is pretty good for me, I’ve found.</p>

<p>I hope that this was at least mildly entertaining, if not actually helpful. I hope it also goes without saying that this is really intensely personal stuff, that I am not a therapist, guru or influencer, just a Padawan in search of The Force, and a person who shares in the hopes of helping other folks.</p>

<h2>"Luminous beings are we... not this crude matter."</h2>
