In the project we worked on together, Will had a profound impact on the way our architecture evolved, and ensured the success of the project. He's also an incredibly cool guy to spend time with."

<blockquote>
"Will is a relentless leader, not afraid to tackle any job necessary to successfully accomplish a project. When we worked together, Will had his hands full managing the relationship between the Australian office and the U.S. headquarters, producing award-winning experiences and executing constantly changing directives... but he still took the time to maintain strong inner and outer department relationships. Mr. Sherman will certainly bring an energizing fire to any team."

<blockquote>
"I've worked with Will on recent projects and was extremely pleased to see the way he engaged with our clients. His approach in workshops really helped both technical and non-technical people to understand, and get excited about UX concepts without being overwhelmed. He was able to open their eyes to discover new possibilities, enhancements, and better approaches to architecture and design of which they would have otherwise thought not possible, or not thought of at all! Will is a driven guy who genuinely loves his work, he's personable to clients and team mates, and I hope to work with him again some day."

"Will is great at both leading a team and being a member of a team. He keeps a cool head, makes sure everyone stays focused, and encourages you along the way. He also does his best to ensure everyone has fun. Will has a great sense of humor, and he has that magic ability to somehow make bad news seem not so bad. Whether he's managing a project or leading a team, I'd heartily recommend Will Sherman."

"I worked with Will on a QLD Govt project, he is amazing at finding what users would like to experience. He is really good with non-technical people's expectations while at the same time keeping in mind what could actually be developed by the developers. He is extremely supportive at both professional and personal levels and is an amazing guy. It has been a great experience working with him and I would love to work with him again anytime."

"I've had the pleasure of working with Will on multiple technical projects. His ability to clearly and effectively communicate in cross-functional teams helped us easily overcome a multitude of obstacles.

It is his ability to function effectively in high-stress situations and his collaborative leadership style that makes him an asset to any team."
