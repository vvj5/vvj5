    <h2>User feedback</h2>

<blockquote>"Will is a talented designer, collaborative stakeholder, and skilled communicator. A straight shooter, Will is honest, empathetic, and passionate about being curious and designing the optimum solution for the customer and the business. We've worked on several high profile projects and it's been an absolute pleasure ideating and co-designing together."
<br />
~Natasha Gould [Manager, Customer Experience @ Credit Union Australia]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Through several projects Iâ€™ve found Will to be a great collaborator both imaginative and with design thinking skills. He grasps the business initiative but adds some beautiful idiosyncrasies that make his designs stand out. A pleasure to work with."
<br />
~Darrin Hanigan [Senior Manager CX @ Credit Union Australia]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Will is an excellent communicator, able to architect and design outstanding user experiences by immersing himself in the lives of end-users and reverse engineering the concepts behind those world class experiences. In the project we worked on together, Will had a profound impact on the way our architecture evolved, and ensured the success of the project. He's also an incredibly cool guy to spend time with."
<br />
~Stefan Gordean [Principal Solutions Consultant @ Enable Professional Services]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Will is a relentless leader, not afraid to tackle any job necessary to successfully accomplish a project. When we worked together, Will had his hands full managing the relationship between the Australian office and the U.S. headquarters, producing award-winning experiences and executing constantly changing directives... but he still took the time to maintain strong inner and outer department relationships. Mr. Sherman will certainly bring an energizing fire to any team."
<br />
~Ken Jager [Assistant Manager: Internal Communications @ Nintendo]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"I've worked with Will on recent projects and was extremely pleased to see the way he engaged with our clients. His approach in workshops really helped both technical and non-technical people to understand, and get excited about UX concepts without being overwhelmed. He was able to open their eyes to discover new possibilities, enhancements, and better approaches to architecture and design of which they would have otherwise thought not possible, or not thought of at all! Will is a driven guy who genuinely loves his work, he's personable to clients and team mates, and I hope to work with him again some day."
<br />
~Paul Austin [ServiceNow Technical Consultant @ Enable Professional Services]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Will is great at both leading a team and being a member of a team. He keeps a cool head, makes sure everyone stays focused, and encourages you along the way. He also does his best to ensure everyone has fun. Will has a great sense of humor, and he has that magic ability to somehow make bad news seem not so bad. Whether he's managing a project or leading a team, I'd heartily recommend Will Sherman."
<br />
~Matthew Giardina [Automation Developer @ EA]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Will is a loyal, devoted and committed leader who possess excellent communication skills and has the ability to think outside the square. He is a high achiever and a progressive individual."
<br />
~George Nissirios [Digital Director, GND Creative]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Will is phenomenal at being able to balance corporate guidelines and initiatives with the needs of local teams and users across multiple regions and projects. Will has a great personality, big creativity and an eagerness to help the whole team succeed."
<br />
~Rebecca Lashley [Senior Management Consultant @ The Octave Group]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"I worked with Will on a QLD Govt project, he is amazing at finding what users would like to experience. He is really good with non-technical people's expectations while at the same time keeping in mind what could actually be developed by the developers. He is extremely supportive at both professional and personal levels and is an amazing guy. It has been a great experience working with him and I would love to work with him again anytime."
<br />
~Subhash Uniyal [Technical Developer @ Enable Professional Services]
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"I've had the pleasure of working with Will on multiple technical projects. His ability to clearly and effectively communicate in cross-functional teams helped us easily overcome a multitude of obstacles. However, it is his ability to be both a vital team member and a leader that shines through when working with Will. It is his ability to function effectively in high-stress situations and his collaborative leadership style that makes him an asset to any team."
<br />
~Rob Daly [Full Stack Developer @ CoStar Group]
