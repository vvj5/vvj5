As a part of my eternal introspection, and as a devout follower of The Cult of UX, I put this question to myself one day- “Where does UX live?” I mean, is UX just a tech thing? Honestly, I feel like I’ve always done UX in one way or another, regardless of industry or role.

I think back into the dizzyingly distant past of 1998, when I giddily began my professional career as a visual designer. I went on to build websites, then ran my own multi-disciplinary creative agency, then moved into an executive marketing role, and also did a lot of events work along the way.

Back then (and still all-to-frequently now), the industry-standard approach to any kind of project, be-it creative or tech, usually would go something like this:

- The customer bigwigs and the account manager get together, decide what to make, how long it will take and how much it will cost.

- The Account Manager tells the developers & creative team what to make.

- The developers & creative team make something.

- The Account Manager goes back and forth between their production team and the customer bigwigs, some adjustments are made.

- The bigwigs roll out the finished project to their users/audience.

I always found this kind-of ass-backwards, and never understood why the users were left out of the loop til the very end. Over the years, I started to develop a “user-centric”, more collaborative approach to projects.

The first thing I changed about the standard process was to eliminate the account managers. This saved both money and time, eliminated “Chinese Whispers” and created transparency and accountability. Then, as the person who would actually be creating or building the project, I would discuss project goals and ideas at length directly with my customers and would always really question things from a user’s perspective. Whenever possible, I would ask to talk to members of the target audience/user group and pick their brains about their perceptions and needs, and would test drafts similarly before moving forward. I made great efforts to see my work through the eyes of the end-customers/users and include them in the process early on.

I just saw this approach as common sense, really, and never understood why no-one else saw the value in it.

Years later, this philosophy has been more formally defined as “User Experience Design” (with some variation in terminology). Now that UX is officially “a thing,” I’ve embraced it as my profession and my passion. It suits my personality, experience and talents well, and I absolutely believe in its value, both to users and to stakeholders.

So was I really doing UX as a creative? As a marketing exec? In events? I see the first step to an answer as delineating the components of UX (in as general a sense as I can)

The UX process:

- Discovery

- Planning

- Execution

- Evaluation

- Adjustment

- Iteration


UX skillsets:

- Communication

- Empathy

- Analysis

- Creativity

- Problem-solving

UX purpose:

- Understand the end-user/audience’s needs

- Deliver a positive experience

- Achieve specific, measurable goals

So how would this UX framework apply to creative, marketing or events?

Discovery when applied to creative, marketing, events = lots of questions that boil down to:

- “Who is this for?”

- “What do they need?”

- “What should we do?”

Planning when applied to creative, marketing, events:

- Brainstorm, workshop, map-out, budget, timeline

- Anticipate user needs and situations

- Determine measures

- Test plans with appropriate users

The rest is pretty straightforward when applied to creative, marketing, events:

- Create something

- Evaluate measures we built-in

- Adjust what we built

- Iterate to make it better

Creative is a process that requires an understanding of the intended audience, a tactical strategy and rationale based on specific goals, testing of initial drafts, refinement and iteration until the design is right. Measures can (and should) be built-in, using a variety of techniques, and at the end of the project, we should be able to see if our efforts met the needs of the stakeholders and the users. The creative project process is very similar to that of UX, but with more focus on the “Execution” node than UX would have.

Marketing as a process is almost indistinguishable in form from UX. The main difference is really pretty basic- UX is pure marketing applied to a digital interface. “Discovery, Planning, Execution, Evaluation, Adjustment, Iteration” is 100% the same as the marketing process. The main difference I can see is that UX is usually a lot more focussed on the “Discovery” and “Planning” segments, where marketing tends to be more balanced across all of the nodes.

Events as compared to UX is a really interesting discussion for me. A trade show is basically a visceral, complete UI sensory experience, and the UX strategic design approach to a show booth project is just as immersive (if not more so) as a web UX project. It’s basically a digital UX project brought into 3D reality.

For example, when considering the selection, orientation and layout of a trade show booth, I have to put myself into an imaginary “Google Maps Street View” mode and anticipate what a show attendee would see, hear, smell, feel and think as they navigate the entire show, in order to best attract and engage the correct audience for my booth.

And again, the same questions — “Who are we looking for?” “What are their needs?” “How can we make their lives easier?” “Are our sensory components attracting, directing and speaking to our target audience?” As with web or print UX, some approaches that would work for certain audiences would be off-putting to others.

As added UX factors, a trade show event must also address the issues of comfort and approachability, and must also balance the issue of “is the swag giveaway at our booth creating lasting and repeated impressions or is it just a waste of money?”

When planning an entertainment event, there are a number of similar UX factors as a trade show, but often (though not always) on a larger scale. But the complex blend of logistics and practicality with aesthetic and experience can be very different.

But again, very similar questions to a UX project discovery stage are asked “Who will be attending?” “What are attendee needs and expectations?” “Are the visual aids directing attendees correctly and efficiently?” “Are we making attendee experience easy and pleasant while staying in budget?”

Looking back at my career through a UX lens, I can see that UX featured heavily in nearly every role I’ve held. It’s been an approach, a perspective and a philosophy that I’ve always used.

UX is absolutely not limited to the tech industry, apps or websites. It can (and does) exist in many roles if you choose to apply it. It just changes medium.

So, to answer my own question of myself, “Where does UX actually live?” It exists wherever you choose to apply it.
