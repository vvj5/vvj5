While working as a Senior UX Designer at CUA (Credit Union Australia), I was tasked with the redesign of the Contact Us page. Here's how I approached this project...<br><br>

<h1>1. Understand the problem and benefits</h1>

<h3>The problem to be solved:</h3>
Determine what users want and need from a contact page and allow them to access it as swiftly as possible, with a focus on the ability to self-service.
<br><br>
<h3>Potential benefits of this project:</h3>
- Reduce call centre eunquiry volume
- Improve user experience and satisfaction (self-service, good service experience)
<br><br>

<h1>2. Discovery & Analysis</h1>

<h3>Competitive analysis - what are other institutions doing with their contact page(s)?</h3>
1. What are they calling it?
2. How do they get users to it?
3. What sections do they break it into?
4. What other links do they include?
5. Any other interesting notes or ideas?
<br><br>

<h3>Website search data analysis</h3>
1. What are users searching for?
2. What terminology are users entering?
3. What are users unable to find swiftly by just scanning and clicking through our site?<br>

- Looked at 6 months of data
- 198 line items
- Many variations on terms and spelling
- In order to better understand the search term data, I grouped the items into themes, then sorted them into rankings by popularity.

<h3>Call centre data analysis</h3>
- What are users calling for help with?
- Looked at 6 months of data
- 152 line items
- I grouped the items into as similar themes as I could to the website search data, then sorted into rankings by call volume.

<h3>Observations from traffic and click-through data (Google Analytics, CrazyEgg)</h3>
1. Redundant links & terms causing confusion about where to click ("contact", "login").
2. Poorly indicated links and CTAS have users clicking on section titles, bullet points and tiles.
3. Unclear navigation throughout the whole site drives a lot of users to the contact page.
4. Users are navigating to the contact page, then out to other website pages, indicating inability to find solutions on the contact page.
5. Only 19.83% of visitors to the contact page click on something within the contact page.<br><br>

<h3>Combine and analyze data themes</h3>

<h4>What is the combined data telling us?</h4>
- I combined the most common themes from all of the data sources, then sorted by popularity.
- This information provided the guidance to inform the page design.

<h1>3. Design phase</h1>

<h3>Create wireframes</h3>
- Mobile-first design
- Highlight search bar
- List main user help topics in order of statistical need
- Help topics expand to reveal more common needs in respective categories
- Product support sections link to most relevant (existing) support pages
- Additional CTAs added and highlighted by relevance and benefit
- Links mapped to wireframe
- Presented to stakeholders and approval received

<h4>Mapped-out links</h4>

<h4>Next steps</h4>
- Send to copywriting for copy review and refinement
- Send to UI for design review and refinement
- Discuss "anticipated wait time" widget with front-end development
- Submit for Legal approval
- Write front-end development specifications card for Trello
