<h1>Our remit: add a feature that will help members avoid spending their savings.</h1>

<h3>The problem to be solved & potential benefits:</h3>
Banking customers are looking for innovative digital ways to avoid the temptation of spending their savings. <br><br>

- Attractive to Millennials
- Point of differentiation for CUA
