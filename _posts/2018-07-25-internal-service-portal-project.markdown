This project was undertaken to create an internal company service portal for an organisation that would be used across all departments, from HR to Project Development. I was asked to architect the site strucure, give it a complete UX approach and design the user interface.<br>
<br>
<h4>My process involved:</h4>
<h4>A survey to the team to determine user types and needs:</h4>
<blockquote><h4>Preliminary user questions:</h4><br>
1. What is your role?<br><br>
2. What stuff do you use/need to find a lot?<br><br>
3. What do you use this stuff for?<br><br>
4. How do you currently find these things?<br><br>
5. What are common pain points with this process currently?<br><br>
6. In the normal course of your job, what technical/administrative tasks cause you irritation?<br><br>
7. What device(s) do you use to perform tasks for your job and engage with the business?<br><br>
8. In a perfect world, what would it be nice to be able to do with this portal?<br><br>
</blockquote>
<h4>Using the results of the survey, I performed in-depth interviews with the various user types, and determined the business goals, portal sections needed, and fleshed-out user types:</h4>
  <blockquote><h4>Business goals:</h4> Provide a single point of access to help all team members work smarter and get access to up-to-date information quickly and efficiently<br>
    <h4>Sections:</h4><br>
Docs - Integrate all internal files (Sales documents, images, case studies) - main document repository will remain in SharePoint and new information architecture will be implemented to support ease of use<br><br>
Team - internal services (profiles, HR, payroll)<br><br>
Insights - "Knowledge base" - search for previous clients and projects (industries, re-usable elements, how-tos)<br><br>
Projects - project management tool (project lifecycle)<br><br>
Clients - client management tool (sales lifecycle)<br><br>
Resources â€“ resource management tool (assignment, timesheets, costs)<br>
<br>
<h4>User groups</h4> (if not in a group, just access general areas):<br><br>
Management group (including HR)<br><br>
Project /engagement management group<br><br>
Customer success/pre-sales group<br><br>
Delivery/consulting group<br><br>
Labs group (Products, collateral, etc.)<br><br>
Learn group (trainers, schedules, etc.)</blockquote>

<h4>I performed usability testing ("talk me through this while you do it") with team members from all user groups and recommended minor changes before the site went live business-wide.</h4>
