<i>This document is intended to provide a template for a “first meeting” UX workshop (or workshops, depending on how many departments you have). This example is for a multi-branch, enterprise-level service portal project. This is a good place to start if you want to run a UX workshop and need some ideas around how to do it.<br>
  <br>
The goal with this workshop is to collect information that will help you (and your clients):<br>
  • Understand what UX is and why you are there<br>
  • Understand the problems you are trying to design solutions for<br>
  • Understand who the users are and what their needs are<br>
  • Understand what the next steps will be<br>
  <br>
Use and adjust this document as you see fit, just don't be an asshole about it :) </i>

<h4>What is UX? Why are we here?</h4>
  • User Experience (UX) design is a way of designing something from the perspective of the people who will be using it. It puts the user at the heart of a project throughout its development. It is a methodical, collaborative, data-driven process. Benefits of employing UX design include: early buy-in from stakeholders and users, clearer build requirements, easier changeover for the business and fewer surprises during the project!<br>
  • We are here to share our understanding of what we are trying to build.<br>
  • We are here to generate requirements for the build as well as establish benchmark data that will help measure its effectiveness after it is built.<br>
<br>
<h4>Questions for the group: Who are the users?</h4>
  • What are the user types/groups?<br>
  • What are they trying to achieve?<br>
  • How are they currently meeting these needs?<br>
  • What devices are they using?<br>
  • What are their current pain points?<br>
  • In a perfect world, what would it be nice for this product to be able to do?<br>
<br>
<h4>Questions for the group: What value does this product provide?</h4>
  • What user problems are we solving (for each user type)?<br>
  • What business problems are we solving?<br>
  • What are the business goals?<br>
<br>
<h4>Questions for the group: What should we build?</h4>
  • Define your project clearly<br>
  • What features MUST we have?<br>
  • What can we realistically achieve, considering time, resources and budget?<br>
<br>
<h4>Activity for the group: Usage from the Requester’s (“front of house”) perspective</h4>
(If you have multiple branches represented, break-into respective groups, have them do the activity, then have them come back and report to the group)<br>
  • Map common (current) use cases and the current process from a requester’s perspective<br>
  • Present, discuss needs, pain points, hopes<br>
<br>
<h4>Activity for the group: Usage from the Fulfiller’s (“back of house”) perspective</h4>
(If you have multiple branches represented, break-into respective groups, have them do the activity, then have them come back and report to the group)<br>
  • Map common (current) use cases and the current process from a fulfiller’s perspective<br>
  • Present, discuss needs, pain points, hopes<br>
<br>
<h4>Discuss terminology</h4>
  • As a group, discuss “what things should be called”, in regards to navigation, departments/branches, specific services, process steps, etc. Remind the group to think from the perspectives of the people actually using the interface.<br>
<br>
<h4>Discuss visual design needs</h4>
  • Are we doing the visual design (UI)? Is there a marketing department? Is there a style guide? Are there established brand guidelines?<br>
  • Remember the purpose of this project and who is using the interface.<br>
  • Is this product outward-facing or inward-facing?<br>
  • Does it have a marketing impact or is it just a tool?<br>
  • Discuss accessibility and what measures should be taken (colourblind palette, mouse ability, etc)<br>
  • Explain that you need to test the product usability BEFORE and AFTER the visual design has been implemented to ensure the UX remains intact. “Bad UI design can wreck good UX design”.<br>
<br>
<h4>Discuss next steps:</h4>
  • I’ll compile the outcomes from this workshop into a guiding document<br>
  • I will socialise the guiding document for feedback and adjust as needed<br>
  • Once we’ve agreed on the approach, I’ll start creating preliminary solutions wireframes for validation and feedback<br>
  • Socialise the solutions drafts, test, adjust, and iterate until consensus is reached<br>
  • Apply visual design to solution designs<br>
  • Retest usability, adjust, iterate as needed<br>
