<i>The purpose of this document is to serve as a starting place for a usability survey. You should test usability before, during and after your project, in order to get a feel for:</i><br>
<br>
  <i>- What needs work from a usability perspective<br>
<br>
  <i>- How your work is coming along<br>
<br>
  <i>- What value you've added to the project<br>
    <br>
<i>
Test early and often. You may notice that I've worded this survey to remove as much "opinion of visual design" as possible, aiming the user intead on the actual USABILITY of the product. I also try to make the response options as sensible as possible, always adding a "comments" section for people to elaborate.<br>
<br>
You’re welcome to use and change this document as you see fit, just don't be an asshole about it :)

<h2>(ProjectName) usability survey</h2>
<br>
We need your feedback to see if there are areas we could improve-upon to make this tool/site/app as useful and successful as possible.<br>
<br>
Just use the interface as naturally as you can – try to locate the items you’d normally use or look for most often, making note of any issues you might have while using the interface – confusion, frustration, anything missing or needing adjustment.<br>
<br>
Please feel relaxed about this session- this is feedback for OUR PROJECT, it’s NOT a test of your abilities!<br>
<br>
Thank you for your help~<br>
