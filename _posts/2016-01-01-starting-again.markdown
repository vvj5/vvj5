In 1998, at 23, I moved from Austin, Texas to Sydney, Australia, where I started again.

In 2008, at 33, I moved back to Austin, and started again. Again.

In 2016, at 41, I moved from Austin, Texas to Brisbane, Australia, and started again, again. Again.

Moving overseas is a special kind of mixture of terror and exhilaration.

The overwhelming logistics themselves make your nose bleed, and the fear of the possibilities of the unknown mingles with the elation of the possibilities of the unknown.

You sell everything you own - house, cars, furniture, electronics, books, DVDs, give most of your clothes to charity. You cancel your insurances, cancel your internet, cancel your mobile phone, cancel your utilities, forward your mail. You say goodbye to family and dear friends and the place you know like the back of your hand, board a plane, land in a brand new place and start again.

Then, just as you've gotten to know your new place like the back of your hand, set up all your applicable services, made new dear friends and re-purchased all the things you had before, you go through the whole thing again.

Then you do it again, just for good measure.

There is a special kind of freedom of starting again in a new place. No-one knows you. You feel a bit like a spy or a ghost. No-one has any expectations of you and you have no reputation. But at the same time, no-one has any expectations of you and you have no reputation.

At 23, this was a mostly exhilarating prospect for me, but I had pretty much no idea what I was doing. At 33, it was kind-of exhilarating, but kind-of terrifying. At 41, it is mostly terrifying, but this time I at least sorta know what I am doing.
