"Critical Path" was a mothballed application project I was engaged to salvage that had last been touched five years previously. The app's intent was to be a "project management tool for non-project-managers" - to help with task creation, tracking and reporting across a multitude of projects simultaneously.

I was tasked with assessing, designing the product and overseeing the re-development of the entire project.

The discovery phase involved meticulously exploring and mapping the existing app, and making notes about bugs and functionality.

I also performed extensive research and competitive analysis - researching similar apps, noting their features, differences and marketing approach.

The original app had been built without a sitemap, and there were broken links, missing buttons, inconsistent labelling and confusing workflows.

I stepped away from the existing app, brainstormed extensively and wireframed what I felt would be a helpful basic workflow and feature list for the app.

I then went back to the existing app and worked out what we had, what I wanted, what the delta between the two was and how to get there.

A lot of this part of the process involved writing User Personas, User Stories, creating a new sitemap and creating screen mockups to guide the dev team.

The wrap of the project included designing a sleek, modern UI and instructing the dev team on how the components were to function.

This project was very rewarding creatively (I love renovation in general), though it would have been easier to start the project from scratch.
