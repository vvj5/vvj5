<p>We have been hosting my parents-in-law at our home for the past month (!), and I’ve been thinking often (really often) about the issue of effective (and ineffective) communication and how important it is to speak in terms that your listener will understand (and respond well to).</p>

<p><img src="/images/resources/words.jpeg" /></p>

<p>My inlaws are Philippino-Australians, and I am very fond of them, so let’s get that out of the way first. To say their English is not very strong is an understatement, and when they do use it, it’s mostly Aussie English, which even native English speakers sometimes find perplexing (get a dog up ya, ya drongo, crikey).</p>

<p>I have known them for about 13 years now, and I am very used to how they speak. Of course, it also helps that my wife speaks Tagalog (the main native language of the Philippines) around the house sometimes and I lived in Australia for ten years (I can tell a bogan from a bevan, I know to bring snags to a sizzle and I know what a budgie-smuggler is).</p>

<p>I first started to remember some of the differences and need to change my syntax when we started talking to our guests about some upcoming weather changes. “The high is going to drop from 78 to 45 and the wind is going to shift from the south to the north, you know how it is in December” just makes them blink and make weird faces (they work in celsius, are from a hemisphere where the cold weather comes from the south and December is summertime). They are unfamiliar with “Imperial” units of length and weight (they use metric) and they know nothing of the politics, geography or slang here in Texas.</p>

<p>My mother-in-law struggled with the oven. It’s in Fahrenheit (not the celsius she’s used to), “broil-hi” nearly set the leche-flan on fire and there’s no “grill” button. My father-in-law would stare blankly at my mother when she’d explain that she “had some friends fixing to visit from Temple, which is about 30 miles south of Waco, where the Branch Davidian thing was.”</p>

<p>Our 2 1/2 year old son could barely understand a word from either one of my wife’s parents, which made him a bit wary of them for a long time until they discovered the universal language of “Hot Wheels cars” and “ride Lolo (grandpa) like a horse.” He also still refers to his Lolo as “Yuyu,” because two-year-olds.</p>

<p>I started to think (just the tiniest bit) about how critical it is to communicate in language that will be understood by your audience, and how important it is to consider your syntax when in discussion with a customer or co-worker (or inlaw).</p>

<p>I could say to a client “OK, I want to do some data analysis and also get usability baselines from both your users and fulfillers. We need to map out your service hierarchies and start documenting some task flows. We also need to make sure your site is fully responsive across all devices and that the UI is following best practices. We’ll do some lo-fi wireframes for the next sprint, then we can bring you in on the standup and see what we need to do in the next iteration.”</p>

<p>Y’all most likely know exactly what all that means, but a client might just hear old fax machine transmission noises, which could confuse or even alienate them, and that would suck, especially if they don’t remember fax machines.</p>

<p>When communicating with clients, co-workers, (heck, anybody really), we always need to use our muscular powers of super-empathy to see through their eyes, hear through their ears, feel with their hearts, uh, smell with their noses… digest with their… ok, let’s end this metaphor before it gets out of hand.</p>

<p>Anyway, we need to be sure to adjust our language to be sure we’re on the same page and understood. What a word might mean to you and what it might mean to someone else could be completely different, and in a usability context this is really critical stuff.</p>

<p>That’s not to say you should “talk-down-to” an audience, just don’t automatically assume everyone knows what “validation,” “A/B testing” or a “deliverable” is. Keep the trade jargon to a minimum and keep your eyes and ears open for signs from someone that say “WTF did you just say?”</p>

<p>As I say to my toddler when he throws himself on the floor, starts crawling around like a pillbug and whining, “Use your words, dear.”</p>
