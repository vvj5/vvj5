This was a one-day workshop for a large energy utility, held at the customer's facility in Adelaide. The engagement was to include the workshop and a report that would guide their team to keep the usability of their service portal in focus.

<h2>The rundown</h2>
I give a brief introduction of my experience, an explanation of UX design and outline what our goals and process will be:
<ul>
<li>Discuss business goals and project history</li>
<li>Identify users & their needs</li>
<li>Identify business branches included and their challenges</li>
<li>Examine existing portal and processes</li>
<li>Discuss service structure</li>
<li>Examine portal layout and terminology options</li>
<li>Determining workshop needs focus</li>
</ul>

I ask questions to learn: the business goals for the portal; who the users are; and where we need to focus our attention for the UX:

Q- What are the business goals?<br>
A- Integrate all branches (eventually) and services into one portal, allow self-service, increase fulfilment speed, increase status visibility and reduce service desk workload.<br>
<br>
Q- Is this portal for internal or external users (or both)?<br>
A- Internal only<br>
<br>
Q- What branches of your business will be putting their services on this portal?<br>
A- IT, Facilities, Payroll/HR<br>
<br>
Q- How do users currently access these services, and what are their most common complaints?<br>
A- Via the service desk: email, phone, walk-in<br>
<br>
We look at some of their current (old) portal pages and discuss how we might be better able to lay-out the navigation, then I start sketching view options on the whiteboard.

We sketch, discuss and adjust Landing page needs and layout (we come up with a few “quick view” panels, like one for Status and panels for “most common services and KBAs” for each top-level nav item.)<br>

We sketch, discuss and adjust the search results page needs and layout (I suggest tagging KBAs and services so we can include them together in the search results, improving self-service)<br>

Sketch, discuss and adjust Catalog page needs and layout.<br>

We dig-in to the actual services offered by their included branches, categorise them and work on consistent terminology that can apply across the portal.<br>

Having workshopped these layouts and the service groupings and terminology, we reach a point where we are all happy with the state of the wireframes and content.

The ElectraNet team are going to take what we worked on and help their HR and Finance branches work their services into a similar grouping structure and terminology to what we worked out for IT and Facilities.

Comments from their team:
<blockquote>“We had no idea what to expect with this meeting, this has been incredibly helpful”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“What we’ve done in this one 6 hour workshop would have taken us WEEKS otherwise!”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This just makes sense. It seems so simple.”</blockquote>
