      <h1>A really REALLY big service portal project</h1>
<p>(note: <em>This was the fourth time this project had been undertaken by the client</em>)</p>

<h2><u>DISCOVERY PHASE</u></h2>
<p>I started this project by spending 2-3 weeks finding (there was a lot of detective work on this one) and analysing past project documents, requesting and poring over spreadsheets and graphs of data in order to: <br />
    - Understand existing project structure and scope of the project <br />
    - Identify user groups and demographics<br />
    - Analyse service request statistics<br />
    I began to ask questions of various stakeholders to gain comprehension of project segments, resources and where to focus my energies.

  <br /></p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>This project consisted of: five internal branches (HR, IT, Infrastructure, Finance, Procurement)  who would be using the service portal internally as both requesters and fulfillers as approximately 20% of the user base, and the other 80% were external employees in a range of roles, located across the state, who would be using the system as requesters.<br />
<br />
Through long analysis of project requirement docs, user and usage data, I determined that our principal challenge would be creating intuitive navigation that would be successful with all user groups (both internal fulfillers and external requesters), particularly the external requesters, as they accounted for approximately 80% of the system usage and 94% of the user count.<br />
<br />
The most commonly requested service area was by far HR, with the number of service requests double that of the next most commonly requested service area, IT.<br />
<br />
The government branches had varying degrees of understanding, visibility or structure for their own service trees, and there was very limited and dubious usability data. The services lists were not standard in structure across branches, in various states of maintenance, and frequently contained duplication or items that were no longer relevant or active. The terminology used for services was frequently obscure and lengthy.<br />
<br />
Previous project teams had not contained any UX roles, and user and service request data had not been utilised. No-one had ever approached the external user groups (80% of service requests, 94% of users) for inclusion or feedback - which meant input had been limited to corporate branches and executives (20% of service requests, 6% of users). Focus had been primarily on UI design, corporate branch-based navigation structure and out-of-the-box terminology.<br />
<br /></p>
<h2><u>UX DESIGN PHASE</u></h2>
<p><br />A project requirement was to create a navigation that was not branch structured. I spent a couple solid weeks brainstorming and discussing terminology and navigation structures that could accommodate primarily the external users, while still maintaining usability for the five internal branches. The services of the branches were carved-up into the new categories I’d created: Me, Operations, Manager, Support, Information.<br />
  <br />
I named and placed branch service categories as best as I could, debated and refined these navigation categories and sub-categories internally, then presented and explained them in a workshop with the external user representatives (called “Business Managers” or “BMs”). <br /></p>
<h4>The BM workshop</h4>
<p><br />
“Why have you blown our brains apart and tried to put them back together?!” was my favourite takeaway quote from a clearly frustrated BM. How would you rather have this set up?”, I asked. “The way it is on OnePortal”, she replied. The rest of the group agreed.<br />
  <br />
OnePortal is the bloated, confusing, dated intranet for the whole of Queensland Government which I had learned that everyone loves to hate. But these representatives of our largest user group still preferred to navigate to services through the terminology used on OnePortal, which tended to be largely corporate branch based: Finance, HR, Infrastructure, Procurement, IT. <br />
  <br />
They got the idea though of what I had been trying to achieve with my proposed navigation structure, and we ended-up creating a hybrid of their preferred nav structure and mine. We added a topnav item: “Student”, changed “Me” to “You” and changed “Information” to “Knowledge”.<br />
  <br />
What I learned was that, while it might appear that the BMs wanted a branch-based navigation structure, the fact was that they understood these titles as service categories. <br />
  <br />
Posters flapped, Post-Its whipped and the smell of Sharpies filled the room. The BMs were a bit stunned that I was so quickly and easily convinced to adjust to their preferred terminology and structure, and their buy-in was immediate and empassioned. <br />

  <br /></p>
<h4>The corporate workshop</h4>
<p><br />
The following workshop was done with just the internal corporate branch reps, and they discussed and placed their perceived service categories into the new navigation structure, creating their own take on the navigation posters the BMs had created.<br />
    <img src="/images/portfolio/DET/workshop1.jpg" /><br />
  <br />
  <br />
At this point, I started to create some lo-fi wireframes and tinker with screens for various user types and sections, attempting to balance a simple interface with a huge catalog of services. I was very careful to avoid introducing style elements, and focused solely on the efficient delivery of content and the mechanics and terminology of the navigation.<br />
    <img src="/images/portfolio/DET/wireframe.jpg" /><br />
  <br /></p>
<h4>The combined workshop</h4>
<p><br />
The week after that we combined the groups: bringing the BMs and corporate branch reps all together. The branch reps each in turn presented “their” pages and discussed their decisions with the BMs. <br />
  <br />
The feedback and perspective both groups acquired in this workshop was invaluable to the project and all of the participants. Hearing the rationales and needs directly from the different user types really helped bring the perspectives to life for the different groups.<br />
  <br />
The value of validated, user-driven navigation was powerful and immediately visible, and effected a sea-change with the attitudes of the corporate branches, who now realised much more clearly the perspective and needs of our largest user group.<br />
  <br />
  I also presented the initial wireframes I’d mocked-up, to better illustrate how the interface would function, and to demonstrate why I needed a consistent hierarchy of services. The feedback I received from all stakeholders was positive, with only a couple minor refinements suggested.

  <br />

  <br />
  The branches were then tasked with refining their service trees, and given a structure hierarchy template to work with that would give them maximum flexibility, while conforming with the information architecture for the service portal.<br />

  <br /></p>

<h2><u>THE BUILD PHASE</u></h2>
<p><br />
After the service trees were refined, I was able to pass the wireframes and section maps to the development team to build. This included a hi-rez UI design I had created, which aimed at making this portal a fast and effective tool, rather than a clunky, bloated show piece. The design was neutral, minimal and content-focused.
I worked closely with the dev team to explain the functions, mechanics and needs of the various elements, and occasionally helped adapt various pieces to make the development more practical. <br />

  <br /></p>
<h2>The testing workshop</h2>
<p><br />
After the initial build was completed, I conducted another combined workshop to test the new interface and get more refinements. <br />
<br />
We let the attendees have a hands-on play-around with an actual online interface, and I was astounded at the positive and emotional response, particularly from the external users.<br /></p>
<blockquote><h2>“You have no idea what this means to us – you’ve changed our lives!”</h2></blockquote>
<p><br />
My takeaway quote from this workshop was “You have no idea what this means to us – you’ve changed our lives!”. The session ended in smiles and hugs from attendees, which really made all the hard work worth it for me.<br /></p>
<h2>The formal usability rollout</h2>
<p><br />
After a few more tweaks, we were ready to send the portal to a wider audience (of about 300) for more formalised testing. I created a digital questionnaire that was careful to keep the focus of opinions on ease of navigation and task achievement, rather than opinions on style. I was also methodical about ensuring the language was clear and neutral, and designed the document to collect both numeric metrics as well as areas for open comments.<br />
<br />
It’s worth noting as well that thorough accessibility testing was also performed on the portal.<br />
<br />
The returning figures and feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with an overall usability rating of 3.8 out of 4.
I finished the project by urging the team to be wary of UI strong-arming by executives (something I had been battling throughout the project), and warned that “bad UI can break good UX.” <br />
<br />
The service portal did at last go live (with some UI changes I was not crazy about), and considering the history and immense complexity of this project, I was very proud to see it successfully implemented, and to this day it is the work I am most proud of in my UX career.<br />
