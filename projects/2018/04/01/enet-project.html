      <p>This was a one-day workshop for a large energy utility, held at the customer’s facility in Adelaide. The engagement was to include the workshop and a report that would guide their team to keep the usability of their service portal in focus.</p>

<h2>The rundown</h2>
<p>I give a brief introduction of my experience, an explanation of UX design and outline what our goals and process will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss business goals and project history</li>
<li>Identify users &amp; their needs</li>
<li>Identify business branches included and their challenges</li>
<li>Examine existing portal and processes</li>
<li>Discuss service structure</li>
<li>Examine portal layout and terminology options</li>
<li>Determining workshop needs focus</li>
</ul>

<p>I ask questions to learn: the business goals for the portal; who the users are; and where we need to focus our attention for the UX:</p>

<p>Q- What are the business goals?<br />
A- Integrate all branches (eventually) and services into one portal, allow self-service, increase fulfilment speed, increase status visibility and reduce service desk workload.<br />
<br />
Q- Is this portal for internal or external users (or both)?<br />
A- Internal only<br />
<br />
Q- What branches of your business will be putting their services on this portal?<br />
A- IT, Facilities, Payroll/HR<br />
<br />
Q- How do users currently access these services, and what are their most common complaints?<br />
A- Via the service desk: email, phone, walk-in<br />
<br />
We look at some of their current (old) portal pages and discuss how we might be better able to lay-out the navigation, then I start sketching view options on the whiteboard.</p>

<p>We sketch, discuss and adjust Landing page needs and layout (we come up with a few “quick view” panels, like one for Status and panels for “most common services and KBAs” for each top-level nav item.)<br />
<img src="/images/portfolio/enet/wireframe_landing_page.jpg" /></p>

<p>We sketch, discuss and adjust the search results page needs and layout (I suggest tagging KBAs and services so we can include them together in the search results, improving self-service)<br />

<p>Sketch, discuss and adjust Catalog page needs and layout.<br />
<img src="/images/portfolio/enet/wireframe_catalog_page.jpg" /></p>

<p>We dig-in to the actual services offered by their included branches, categorise them and work on consistent terminology that can apply across the portal.<br />

<img src="/images/portfolio/enet/services_nav_Facilities.jpg" />
<img src="/images/portfolio/enet/wireframe_contact_page.jpg" /></p>

<p>Having workshopped these layouts and the service groupings and terminology, we reach a point where we are all happy with the state of the wireframes and content.</p>

<p>The ElectraNet team are going to take what we worked on and help their HR and Finance branches work their services into a similar grouping structure and terminology to what we worked out for IT and Facilities.</p>

<p>Comments from their team:</p>
<blockquote>“We had no idea what to expect with this meeting, this has been incredibly helpful”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“What we’ve done in this one 6 hour workshop would have taken us WEEKS otherwise!”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This just makes sense. It seems so simple.”</blockquote>
